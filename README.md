# Developed-and-Populated-Application-Store-Database

This project provides an outline understanding of a database model of an Application Store. This store consists data of all the applications listed in the store as well as the users and developer data.

This model consists of mainly four clusters i.e. Application Cluster, Developer Cluster, User Cluster, and Downloads Cluster, and it also defines the relationship amongst the different entities within the model.

The database model is created using Toad Data Modeler tool.
Using the Toad Data Modeler tool the DDL script is generated and with the help of that script, a database has been created in Microsoft SQL Server. 
After the formation of the database, it is populated with the sample data using DML scripts. 
Additionally, it provides a series of simple queries on the sample data in the database along with the generated output.
